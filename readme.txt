You can also: Disable the "network robots.txt file," allowing you to manually add your own robots.txt file to each Network Website.

A) Yes.


= Q) Can I add multiple or custom sitemap urls?

A) Yes.

== Arbitrary section ==

= Understanding the Default Settings =

When you first enter the plugin admin via the Network Admin, the displayed robots.txt file is the default "network only" copy.


= The Network Append Marker =

The marker {APPEND_WEBSITE_ROBOTSTXT} within the Network Robots.txt File is replaced by Website unique robots.txt file append rules. Use the marker in your customized Network robots.txt files to automatically append the Website robots.txt file rules when the Network is updated.


= Robots.txt Files within Directories =

* This plugin WILL render robots.txt files within directories - however,

* Search Engine Spiders only read robots.txt files found within the root directory of a Website. Spiders do not read robots.txt files within directories, such as: domain.com/PATH-or-FOLDER/robots.txt is NOT a valid location.

* From Google: "The robots.txt file must be in the top-level directory of the host.....Crawlers will not check for robots.txt files in sub-directories."


= Testing Robots.txt Files =

* Use Google's Webmaster Tools to Validate your Robots.txt Files.... with Google at least.:
* Log into your Google Account and access the Log into your Webmaster Tools feature. Select a Website or Add a Website....

* On the Webmaster Tools Home page, click the site you want.
* Under Health, click Blocked URLs.
* If it is not already selected, click the Test robots.txt tab.
* Copy the content of your robots.txt file, and paste it into the first box.
* In the URLs box, list the site to test against.
* In the User-agents list, select the user-agents you want.
* https://developers.google.com/webmasters/control-crawl-index/docs/robots_txt

* Per Site: Then click the "update website rules" button to copy the default robots.txt file to this Website.


= Disabling =

= Presets

* This feature allows you to quickly duplicate premade robots.txt files and a sitemap structure url to the default network robots.txt file. This action does not publish the robots.txt files to the network.
